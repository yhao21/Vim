6. Disable touchpad

		You can disable your Chromebook's touchpad or touchscreen if those features are causing problems.
		 
		First go here: chrome://flags/#ash-debug-shortcuts
		and enable the flag, then click on RESTART NOW at the bottom of that page.
		 
		Once that's done, you have two new keyboard shortcut toggles available to you -
		<Search> + <Shift> + P will toggle the touchpad off/on
		and 
		<Search> + <Shift> + T  will toggle the touchscreen off/on
