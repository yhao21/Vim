				find addition driver, and choose the very top nvidia driver


===============
software:

				install python

				sudo apt install nodejs npm

				install vim-plug coc-nvim

				sudo apt install inkscape

				sudo pip3.8 install inkscape-figures

				install latex at last.
===============



4. change brightness
				sudo apt install brightnessctl

				# change to 50% brightness, customize %, i.e., 70%, 100%
				sudo brightnessctl s 50%


				set shortcuts in .bashrc

				# ==================================
				# brightness
				# ==================================
				alias b1='sudo brightnessctl s 10%'
				alias b2='sudo brightnessctl s 20%'
				alias b3='sudo brightnessctl s 30%'
				alias b4='sudo brightnessctl s 40%'
				alias b5='sudo brightnessctl s 50%'
				alias b6='sudo brightnessctl s 60%'
				alias b7='sudo brightnessctl s 70%'
				alias b8='sudo brightnessctl s 80%'
				alias b9='sudo brightnessctl s 90%'
				alias b10='sudo brightnessctl s 100%'


				NOTICE: DO NOT type 'space' around '='

5. change mouse speed
				# check your mouse id (mine is 10)
								xinput
				# check mouse's property
								xinput list-props 10
				# lower the transformation matrix values to slow down
								xinput set-prop "USB OPTICAL MOUSE" "Coordinate Transformation Matrix" 0.2 0 0 0 0.2 0 0 0 1


				===============
				how does trans matrix work
				===============
				⎡ 1 0 0 ⎤   ⎡ 400 ⎤   ⎡ 400 ⎤
				⎜ 0 1 0 ⎥ · ⎜ 197 ⎥ = ⎜ 197 ⎥
				⎣ 0 0 1 ⎦   ⎣  1  ⎦   ⎣  1  ⎦
				By default, the CTM for every input device in X is the
				identity matrix. As an example, lets say you touch a touchscreen 
				at point (400, 197) on the screen:

				The X and Y coordinates of the device event are input in the 
				second matrix of the calculation. The result of the calculation 
				is where the X and Y coordinates of the event are mapped to the 
				screen. As shown, the identity matrix maps the device coordinates 
				to the screen coordinates without any changes.


				write into your .bashrc

				# ==================================
				# mouse speed
				# ==================================
				alias slow='xinput set-prop "USB OPTICAL MOUSE" "Coordinate Transformation Matrix" 0.2 0 0 0 0.2 0 0 0 1'
				



6. screenshot
				sudo apt install deepin-screenshot

				# Config your i3wm
								comment mod+a in your i3 config file for parent.

7. enable/disable touchpad

				# ==================================
				# disable touchpad
				# ==================================
				alias cj='xinput --disable "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad"'
				alias ck='xinput --enable "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad"'

				

8. screenrecorder----OBS!!!!
