after you have install texlive,
	cd ~
	vim .bashrc
	
write down these:
	PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH;export PATH
	MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/doc/man:$MANPATH;export MANPATH
	INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/doc/info:$INFOPATH;export INFOPATH

refresh your bashrc
	source ~/.bashrc

done!


If you encounter with a no setspace pkg problem, you probably did not write path into 
.bashrc. (do not type those three line in terminal!!)
