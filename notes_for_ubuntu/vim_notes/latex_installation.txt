after you have install texlive,
	cd ~
	vim .bashrc
	
write down these:
	PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH;export PATH
	MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/doc/man:$MANPATH;export MANPATH
	INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/doc/info:$INFOPATH;export INFOPATH

refresh your bashrc
	source ~/.bashrc

done!


If you encounter with a no setspace pkg problem, you probably did not write path into 
.bashrc. (do not type those three line in terminal!!)


If you are in fish terminal, type
	bash
switch to bash terminal.
	source ~/.bashrc

type: fish go back to fish terminal again






###------Install language pack manually------###

If you would like to type spanish letter, e.g., Galı́, do the following:

sudo apt install texlive-lang-spanish

You are all set! No need for \usepackage[spanish]{babel}
