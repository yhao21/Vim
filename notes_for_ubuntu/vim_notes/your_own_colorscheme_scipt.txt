0. Allow transparency

for any color scheme vim script, add transparent hex code before its
background color, then you can make this scheme being transparent

1. Make transparency as default

				you should add <let g:mycolorTransparent = 1> directly
				to mycolor.vim. 
				Hence, you don't need to get transparency by refreshing
				vimrc each time.

				Take a look at nvim/colors/mycolor.vim


2. Where to save your own color scheme

				save in nvim/colors folder.
