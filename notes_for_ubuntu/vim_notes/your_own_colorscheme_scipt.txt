1. Make transparency as default

				you should add <let g:mycolorTransparent = 1> directly
				to mycolor.vim. 
				Hence, you don't need to get transparency by refreshing
				vimrc each time.

				Take a look at nvim/colors/mycolor.vim


2. Where to save your own color scheme

				save in nvim/colors folder.
