		How to open a file using your local pdf reader (in i3wm)?

		For the first pdf you would like to open:
						1. Right click on file
						2. Open in file manager
						3. Open pdf using local pdf reader

		For the rest of pdf, just click on "Open file Natively".


		Note, if you do not open the first pdf from file manager, tagspaces will stuck
		and remain un-responding.
