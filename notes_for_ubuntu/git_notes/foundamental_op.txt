1. write .gitignore
				given this layout:
				
				<midterm_project>
				|
				|___<coin_file>
								|_________<btc.html>
								|_________<abc.html>
				|
				|___<code_file>
								|_________<parsing.py>



				if you want to ignore html files while uploading hw to github,
				write a < .gitignore > file under <midterm_project> dir


				<midterm_project>
				|
				|___<coin_file>
								|_________<btc.html>
								|_________<abc.html>
				|
				|___<code_file>
								|_________<parsing.py>

				|
				|___<.gitignore>
				

				write this in your .gitingore:

								coin_file/*.html

				then your html files will not be uploaded.


2. What if you have uploaded html files to github and you want to delete them.

				cd midterm_project
				git rm -r --cached .
				git add .
				git commit -m "ignore html and upload"
				git push



				Done.



3. undo git add after commit
				after git add and git commit, if you want to undo the commit,
				use this command to go back to last commit. you can do this several time, if you need

				git reset --soft HEAD^
